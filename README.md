# King Terry
#### A Terry A. Davis Tribute
  
Terry A. Davis, commonly referred to as "King Terry" or "The smartest programmer who ever lived," was a programmer who lived from December 15th, 1969 to August 11th, 2018. His life was devoted to TempleOS, a small 64-bit operating system meant to function and "God's Third Temple" and is reminiscent of the Commodore 64. In his own words:  
"[TempleOS] is for programming as entertainment. It empowers programmers with kernel privilege because it's fun. It allows full access to everything because it's fun. It has no bureaucracy because it's fun. It's the way it is by choice because it's fun. [TempleOS] is no way a Windows or Linux wannabe -- that would be pointless."  
  
During his life, Davis gained a cult following online. He streamed himself programming, watching Youtube videos, interacting with his fanbase, and more. However, Davis suffered from schizophrenia, which both impacted his life and work on TempleOS. In memory of Terry Davis, please help alleviate the struggle of mental illness and donate to [The BBR Foundation](https://www.bbrfoundation.org/), [NAMI](https://www.nami.org/Home), and [download TempleOS](https://templeos.org/Downloads/TempleOS.ISO).  
  
The tributary project itself is a replication of one of TempleOS's more well known programs, GodSpeak. Davis believed he could speak with God through a random number generator. This take on GodSpeak essentially does the same thing, though will never be the same as the original program. And like TempleOS, this project is in the public domain.  
  
#### Rest in Peace, Terry A. Davis.
